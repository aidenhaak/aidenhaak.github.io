<h1 class=post-title>Samsung Google Divorce?</h1><span class=post-date>February 6, 2014</span>
<p>With the recent sale of the remnants of <a href=http://investor.google.com/releases/2014/0129.html title="Lenovo to Acquire Motorola Mobility from Google">Motorola Mobility to Lenovo</a> Google has managed to at least salvage something from its expensive mistake. That is Google and Samsung kissing and making up with the recent <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25908364 title="Google and Samsung sign global patent deal">cross patent licensing deal</a> signed between the two companies.</p><p>While there has been talk of a Samsung-Google divorce in the past, it came to a <a href=http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsungs-secret-mission-cut-google-galaxy/ title="Samsung’s secret mission to cut Google out of its Galaxy">head at the recent CES 2014</a> where Samsung unveiled its <em>&ldquo;Magazine UX&rdquo;</em> interface. Which is at the very least is a departure from Samsung&rsquo;s <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchwiz title=Touchwiz>Touchwiz</a> (which seems to be permanently stuck looking like Android Gingerbread). And at the very worst, a major divergence from Google&rsquo;s blessed vanilla version of Android</p><p>However with this latest deal Google has managed to extend an olive branch to Samsung and as result the company will dial back its <a href=http://recode.net/2014/01/29/after-google-pressure-samsung-will-dial-back-android-tweaks-homegrown-apps/ title="After Google Pressure, Samsung Will Dial Back Android Tweaks, Homegrown Apps">Android tweaks and return to a more vanilla offering</a>. Ben Thompson also makes an <a href=http://stratechery.com/2014/googles-tasty-lemonade/ title="Google’s Tasty Lemonade">interesting point</a> about the deal observing:</p><blockquote>
<p>While Re/code attempted to paint the latter deal as some sort of intimidation on Google’s part, it seems obvious that the reason Google “won” both of these deals was Motorola: specifically, Google likely offered to get out of hardware if Samsung cross-licensed their patents and stopped pseudo-forking Android. Given Samsung’s dominant position in the Android ecosystem, the Motorola bargaining chip very well may have been worth several billion dollars.</p></blockquote><p>This is not the only thing Google is doing to combat the Android <a href=https://www.abiresearch.com/press/q4-2013-smartphone-os-results-is-google-losing-con title="Q4 2013 Smartphone OS Results: Is Google Losing Control of the Android Ecosystem?">forking threat</a> as it is gradually locks down Android with <a href=http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/10/googles-iron-grip-on-android-controlling-open-source-by-any-means-necessary/ title="Google’s iron grip on Android: Controlling open source by any means necessary">closed source creep</a> attack on ASOP as the company attempts to protect <em>&ldquo;Google Android&rdquo;</em> from alternative versions by making Google services the main compelling reason to own an Android device.</p><p>This deal is also a big win for Lenovo as it acquires a foothold in the <a href=http://wallstanalyst.com/research-desk/hot-w/1102-drunken-marriage-ends-in-quick-divorce-peeks-into-google-s-plan-for-the-future title="Drunken Marriage Ends in Quick Divorce; Peeks into Google’s plan for the future">US smartphone market along with Motorola&rsquo;s branding and infrastructure</a>. And with Lenovo&rsquo;s proven track record selling low margin PC hardware, they will definitely come out swinging and are likely to snap up a <a href=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-08/htc-posts-record-low-profit-after-latest-smartphone-delayed.html title="HTC Posts Record-Low Profit After Latest Smartphone Delayed">weakened HTC</a> further strengthening their Motorola beachhead.</p><p>So for now it seems as though the Samsung-Google marriage is safe, however I think with entry of Lenovo into the smartphone market leaves a number of interesting questions to be answered in the coming months and years. Will Google be able to keep Android locked down or will a forked version of Android emerge out of China? Would this be enabled by the emergence of another API/service provider?</p><p>Will Samsung fork Android themselves like Amazon has done? And do they have the technical chops to pull it off?</p><p>Whatever happens we&rsquo;re in for an exciting ride.</p></article><div class=post-comments>
