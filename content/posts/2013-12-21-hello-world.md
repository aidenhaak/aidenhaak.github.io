I'm Aiden Haak and this my obligatory hello world post to launch my blog. I currently live in Australia and work as a software engineer. Thus most of my posts will deal with programming and technology as the norm.

Even though [blogging could be dead](http://kottke.org/13/12/rip-the-blog-1997-2013 "R.I.P. The Blog, 1997-2013") (I've only missed the boat by almost 10 years) I've always wanted at the very least my own website or blog. So that I could scrapbook my ideas and software projects over time. I'm not exactly expecting fame and glory or my blog to change my life, but I am hopeful that I can at least strengthen my writing muscle and share some interesting facts and if I [keep posting](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html "Fire And Motion") everyday, maybe one day this blog might [gradually start to suck less](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/03/sucking-less-every-year.html "Sucking Less Every Year").

Updates will be available on [twitter]({{ site.author.twitter }} "Twitter") and [RSS](/atom.xml "RSS").
