*tl;dr: Go for QSuper if your balance is under $100k otherwise choose Sunsuper but make sure to choose the passive investment options (alththough this might change if the [rumored merger](https://www.investmentmagazine.com.au/2019/11/qsuper-and-sunsuper-in-early-merger-talks/) goes ahead...).*


I've taken the liberty of trawling through a bunch of super fund websites and product disclosure statements so you don't have to. 

second largest asset etc etc 

so you should care

As last time I changed super funds I spent a good chunk of time reading the super fund product disclosure statements. 

I'm going to assume that readers are somewhat financially literate and are at least aware of things such as: investment options, asset allocation and the difference between passive and active investing. Instead the readers are just looking for the best super fund with the lowest fees to invest their money and would like to save time reading a bunch of PDSs.

First a few disclaimers about this post - this definitely not financial advice so make sure you do your **OWN** research before making any super fund decisions. Secondly income protection, life and TPD insurance is outside the scope for these comparisons so you will need to investigate insurance options yourself. 

I will be limiting this comparison to the super funds management and investment fees. I won't be diving particularly deep into the investment options avaiable with details such as: use a of deriviatives and gearing outside the scope. Partly because super funds seem to be somewhat opaque regarding investment details like this and secondly to a deep dive would be not insignificant undertaking. A good start for a deeper dive is [here](https://lifelongshuffle.com/2019/03/24/not-so-super-retirement-savings-part-3/).

I will also be excluding from the scope of this comparison the DIY or self managed investments that some funds offer where you can buy and sell your own shares.

## The Competitiors

I've limited my comparison to the larger, more well known and most importantly open funds. That is super funds that open to anybody rather than be limited to certain companies (e.g. Telstra Super). I've avoided the smaller funds since they can suffer from *"shrinking assets"*, whereby more money is being taken out than what is being put in by the funds members. This is further compounded by the fact that the smaller funds miss out on the economies of scale that the larger funds can enjoy.

I've also tried to make sure to include a variety of industry and retail funds.

### Australian Super

First cab off the rank is the Australian Super, it is one of the largest and best known industry funds in Australia. Members are slugged with an administration fee $117pa in addition to an investment fee that depends on a memeber's investment choices. 

The pre-mixed investment options are pretty vanilla:

| Description           | Investment Fee      |
|:----------------------|--------------------:|
| High Growth           | 0.67%               |
| Balanced              | 0.66%               |
| Socially Aware        | 0.74%               |
| Indexed Diversified   | 0.16%               |
| Conservative Balanced | 0.52%               |
| Stable                | 0.41%               |

Of most interest is the indexed diversified option with a relatively low fee due to its passive investment approach. However, its high allocation to cash of ~13% I feel makes this an unattractive option since this stunts potential capital growth and members don't have the option to change the asset allocation. The other options are pretty bland and on the slightly higher side in terms of investment fees. 

Australian Super's individual investment options are equally uninteresting:

| Description                  | Investment Fee      |
|:-----------------------------|--------------------:|
| Australian Shares            | 0.34%               |
| International Shares         | 0.56%               |
| Property                     | 0.85%               |
| Diversified Fixed Interest   | 0.47%               |
| Cash                         | 0.05%               |

Unfortunately they offer no lower fee passive investment options and none of the slightly more exotic investment options such as fixed infrastructe or private equity. Overall a pretty average offer which is disappointing from one of the largest funds.

### CBUS Super

Next up is the Construction and Building Unions super or CBUS super for short. A CBUS super account comes with an administration fee of $104pa plus 0.08% which is capped at $640pa. In addition to the administration and investment fees a trustee cost of 0.11% is applied.

| Description           | Investment Fee      |
|:----------------------|--------------------:|
| Growth                | 0.65%               |
| Cash Savings          | 0.07%               |
| Conservative          | 0.30%               |
| Conservative Growth   | 0.47%               |
| High Growth           | 0.76%               |

CBUS unfortunatley offers no individual investment options. This combined with the high fees (especiall for people with low balances) makes for a very underwhelming super offering.

### Colonial First State Super

### First State Super

### HOSTPLUS Super

Now we come to another one of the larger industry super funds

administration fee of $78pa

| Description                   | Investment Fee      | Indirect Costs |
|:------------------------------|--------------------:|---------------:|
| Capital Stable                | 0.39%               | 0.25%          |
| Conservative Balanced         | 0.43%               | 0.26%          |
| Socially Responsible Balanced | 0.86%               | 0.41%          |
| Indexed Balanced              | 0.02%               | 0.03%          |
| Balanced                      | 0.58%               | 0.33%          |

HOSTPLUS also offers a wide gamut of individual investment options

### ING Super

## Final Words

Whatever super fund you choose I'd suggest that in addition to minimising your fees you have a strong bias away from Australia when choosing your investment options. This is for two chief reasons: 

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            The Australian economy is only a very small proportion of the global economy (only around <a href="https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Australia/gdp_share/">2%</a>)
        </P>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The ASX and its associated indexes are rubbish for diversification purposes. As <a href="https://rogermontgomery.com/why-you-should-steer-clear-of-etfs/">Roger Montgomery</a> states:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                To summarise, the large companies that dominate the Australian index are not only challenged structurally (supermarkets and Telstra) or cyclically (banks and iron ore miners) they are also paying the majority of their earnings out as a dividend. Australia’s franking system ensures dividends are far more valuable to investors than they are to companies. The corollary of a high dividend payout ratio however is a low level of retained earnings for growth. And if earnings don’t grow, neither will the share price longer term.  Telstra is a classic example of this.  Its earnings are scarcely higher than a decade ago and neither are its shares.
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This is magnified by other weaknesses particularly by the big 4 banks' large exposure to the housing market. Thus a sigificant downtuwn in the Australian housing market would be catastrophic for Australian equities <a href="http://www.dougabdiel.com/2016/11/16/an-aside-on-housing/"> re</a>

</ul>
