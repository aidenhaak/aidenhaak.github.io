*Edit: Yep! This is definitely a case of [Poe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law) and this interview is a [spoof](https://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/susan/joke/cpp.htm).*

An [interview with the creator of C++ Bjarne Stroustrup](http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/I_did_it_for_you_all "Bjarne Stroustrup: “I Did It For You All…”") done in 1998 for the IEEE Computer Magazine has recently came to my attention, however I'm not entirely convinced of it's veracity. Here's an excerpt of particular interest:

> Stroustrup: Well, one day, when I was sitting in my office, I thought of this little scheme, which would redress the balance a little. I thought ‘I wonder what would happen, if there were a language so complicated, so difficult to learn, that nobody would ever be able to swamp the market with programmers? Actually, I got some of the ideas from X10, you know, X windows. That was such a bitch of a graphics system, that it only just ran on those Sun 3/60 things.. They had all the ingredients for what I wanted. A really ridiculously complex syntax, obscure functions, and pseudo-OO structure. Even now, nobody writes raw X-windows code. Motif is the only way to go if you want to retain your sanity..

And in the past 16 years [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++") has grown to be more complicated if anything with new C++11 and C++14 standards. Can't say I don't agree with some of the other points Stroustrup raises about C++. Interesting implications if this is true.
