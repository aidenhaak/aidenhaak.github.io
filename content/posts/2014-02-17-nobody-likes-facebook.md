I recently saw this video the other day:

{{< youtube oVfHeWTKjag >}}

And it reminded me of Paul Graham's [comments about Yahoo](http://paulgraham.com/yahoo.html "What Happened to Yahoo"):

> By 1998, Yahoo was the beneficiary of a de facto Ponzi scheme. Investors were excited about the Internet. One reason they were excited was Yahoo's revenue growth. So they invested in new Internet startups. The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo to get traffic. Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and further convinced investors the Internet was worth investing in. When I realized this one day, sitting in my cubicle, I jumped up like Archimedes in his bathtub, except instead of "Eureka!" I was shouting "Sell!"

> Both the Internet startups and the Procter &amp; Gambles were doing brand advertising. They didn't care about targeting. They just wanted lots of people to see their ads. So traffic became the thing to get at Yahoo. It didn't matter what type.

Sounds awfully familiar, no?
