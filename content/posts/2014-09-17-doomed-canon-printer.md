Canon's security vulnerability is [another man's challenge to run doom](http://www.contextis.co.uk/resources/blog/hacking-canon-pixma-printers-doomed-encryption/ "Hacking Canon Pixma Printers - Doomed Encryption"):

> So what protection does Canon use to prevent a malicious person from providing a malicious firmware?  In a nutshell - nothing, there is no signing (the correct way to do it) but it does have very weak encryption. I will go into the nuts and bolts of how I broke that later in this blog post.

> So we can therefore create our own custom firmware and update anyoneâ€™s printer with a Trojan image which spies on the documents being printed or is used as a gateway into their network. For demonstration purposes I decided to get Doom running on the printer (Doom as in the classic 90s computer game). 

> It was not straight forward due to it needing all the operating system dependences to be implemented in Arm without access to a debugger, or even multiplication or division. But that's a blog for another day.

Reminds me of this gem from Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal:
