Given the latest update to the [GibSec](http://gibsonsec.org/snapchat/fulldisclosure/ "Snapchat - GibSec Full Disclosure") Snapchat API:

> Using our Snapchat API implementation, someone could save media sent to them, DoS Snapchat users, and as we recently found, build a database of Snapchat usernames and phone numbers, connecting names to aliases easily, and with further work connecting social media accounts to entries.

> We also found that if someone was able to gain access to Snapchat's servers, they could easily view, modify or replace snaps sent. With a couple of lines of python, someone could view all your unread messages, and depending on the situation, modify and even replace the images completely.

Firstly, it makes me glad I never downloaded the Snapchat app. And secondly, I'm thinking there's probably a really cool project using this with [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/ "OpenCV") and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ "scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python") (two libraries I've always wanted to play around with) if I have the time (read: I probably won't). It'd be nothing malicious, just classifying the [pictures as cat or non-cat](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/technology/in-a-big-network-of-computers-evidence-of-machine-learning.html?_r=0 "How Many Computers to Identify a Cat? 16,000").

Betting Snapchat will soon be regretting not taking Facebook's $3 billion.
